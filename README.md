# CaseStudy
The Iconic Case Study solution

The case study have 4 stages and all data related work is completed using Python. To do this the data files were saved at my computer's hard drive after decrypting the password to the file. Stage by stage modules are created in this project contaning respectively code and additional information. There is a separate code module which contains the full code for all the 4 stages. 

Please note that this is created for a case study purpose only and not for production use. Many more steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, third party data gathering, business case understanding, domain knowledge and a thorough QA are required for a production models.
