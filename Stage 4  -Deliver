Q. How did you clean the data and what was wrong with it? Close to 90% of a Data Scientist's job is in cleaning data?
A. Answered in Stage 2

Q. What are the features you used as-is and which one did you engineer using the given ones? What do they mean in the real world?
A. I engineered features like average revenue, male female items ratio to support the segmentation. Approx 15 low importance features were removed from the ANN to make it easier and simpler to build model. I could also remove correlated independent features but our model returned good accuracy so i didn't do in this assignment work. 

Q. What does the output look like - how close is the accuracy of the prediction in light of data with labelled flags?
A. Over 98%

Q. What other features and variables can you think of, that can make this process more robust? Can you make a recommendation of top 5 features you'd seek to find apart from the ones given here
A. Name, Email, Age to be able to understand life stage, Non Aggregated data to understand shopping trend and type of items bought each time, website browising history

Q. Summarize your findings in an executive summary
A. I have already provided commentary, findings and process in respective section wise modules
